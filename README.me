# AWS SNS Single Message Sender

Send a single AWS SNS message

## Motivation

This project was made due to a need for sending one single SNS message from a CronJob inside a Kubernetes Cluster. So you can schedule CronJob runs with the image builded from this project.

## How to use it

Create a file named "message" containing the message you want to send. For example:
```
{"field": "value"}
```
Create a file named "env" from env.dist and fill the environment variables:
```
AWS_KEY=my-aws-key
AWS_SECRET=my-super-secret
AWS_TOPIC_ARN=target-topic-arn
```

### Running with docker
Building:
```
docker build -t <image_name> .
```

Then:
```
docker run --env-file env <image_name>
```
